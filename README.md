## **Programming Language**
### **Rust**
Rust is known for its performance, safety, and concurrency, making it ideal for web applications.  

**Typical Usage of Rust:**
- Systems programming  
- Web development (Actix, Axum)  
- Embedded systems  
- Game development  
- Performance-critical applications  

**Language Characteristics:**
- **Typing:** Statically typed  
- **Paradigms:** Multi-paradigm (supports functional, procedural, and object-oriented programming)  
- **Compilation:** Compiled language using LLVM for optimized machine code  

---

## **Application Overview**
The **Movie Finder Website** will allow users to:
- Search for movies by title, genre, or release year  
- View detailed information, including cast, synopsis, and ratings  
- Save favorite movies (if authentication is implemented)  

This project will showcase Rust‚Äôs strengths in **web development, concurrency, and safety**.  

---

## **Major Features**
‚úÖ **Search Functionality** ‚Äì Users can search for movies by title, genre, or release year.  
‚úÖ **Movie Details Page** ‚Äì Displays movie synopsis, ratings, cast, and release date.  
‚úÖ **User Authentication (Optional)** ‚Äì Allows users to log in and save favorite movies.  
‚úÖ **API Integration** ‚Äì Fetches movie data from an external API (OMDB API, TMDB API).  
‚úÖ **Backend** ‚Äì Built using **Rust** with **Actix Web** or **Axum**.  
‚úÖ **Frontend** ‚Äì Either a Rust-based framework like **Yew** or a separate frontend in **TSX**.  

---

## **Application Structure**
üìå **Home Page** ‚Äì Displays a search bar and trending movies.  
üìå **Search Results Page** ‚Äì Shows a list of movies matching the search query.  
üìå **Movie Details Page** ‚Äì Provides in-depth information about the selected movie.  
üìå **Favorites Page (if authentication is implemented)** ‚Äì Displays a user‚Äôs saved movies.

## **Setup Instructions**
### **Prerequisites**
- Install Rust: [Rust Official Website](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Install Cargo (comes with Rust)
- Install a Rust web framework (Actix Web or Axum)
- Set up a database (if needed)
- API key for movie data (OMDB/TMDB)

### **Run the Project**
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/COSC341-Winter2025/movie-finder.git
   cd movie-finder
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   cargo build
   ```
3. Run the backend server:  
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```
4. Open the frontend (if separate):  
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## **Collaboration Guidelines**
To ensure smooth development, all team members must follow these rules:

### **Branching Strategy**
- The **main** branch should always remain stable.
- Each feature must be developed in a **separate branch**.
- Branch naming convention:  
  ```
  feature/<feature-name>
  fix/<bug-description>
  ```
  Example: `feature/movie-search`, `fix/api-timeout`

### **Commit Guidelines**
- Write **clear commit messages** following this format:  
  ```
  <type>: <short description>
  
  [Optional longer description]
  ```
  Example:  
  ```
  feat: add movie search functionality
  
  Implemented movie search by title, genre, and release year using OMDB API.
  ```

  **Commit Types:**
  - `feat:` (new feature)
  - `fix:` (bug fix)
  - `docs:` (documentation updates)
  - `style:` (formatting, no logic change)
  - `refactor:` (code refactoring)
  - `test:` (adding or modifying tests)

---

## **Pull Request (PR) Rules**
- **Always create a PR** when merging into `main`.  
- Assign at least **one reviewer** (another team member).  
- **PR description must include:**
  - What the feature/bug fix does
  - Any dependencies required
  - Screenshots (if applicable)
- PRs should follow this format:
  ```
  ## Summary
  - Short description of the changes.

  ## Changes Made
  - List key changes.

  ## How to Test
  - Steps to test the feature.

  ## Related Issues
  - Link to any related issues.
  ```
- **No direct pushes to `main`!**  

---

## **Code Review Process**
- **Review each PR** before merging.  
- Look for:
  - Code quality & readability
  - Adherence to Rust best practices
  - Security concerns
  - Functionality testing  
- Use **GitHub comments** to discuss improvements.

---


## **Issue Tracking**
- Bugs and feature requests should be logged under **GitHub Issues**.
- Use appropriate labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, etc.
- Each issue should include:
  - **Title**: Short description of the problem.
  - **Description**: Detailed explanation, steps to reproduce.
  - **Expected Behavior**: What should happen?
  - **Actual Behavior**: What‚Äôs happening instead?

---
